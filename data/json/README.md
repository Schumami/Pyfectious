# Configuration Files

Configuration files in this section correspond to all the experiments we ever designed with Pyfectious. A brief introduction to these setups is as the following.

* [town](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/tree/develop/data/json/town "town"): A sample town designed as a single base run for the simulator. Not directly related to the results in final paper.
* [test](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/tree/develop/data/json/test "test"): Designed test run for faster results with the simulator. Not directly related to the results in final paper.
* [town_optimization](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/tree/develop/data/json/town_optimization "town_optimization"): The town we used to optimize quarantine policies. Related to the results associated with Section 4.2.6 "Finding an optimal policy", Figure 16, and Table 8 of the paper.
* [main_experimental_towns](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/tree/develop/data/json/main_experimental_towns "main_experimental_towns"): Most of the results in the paper come from these setups. More details are in the [README.md](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/blob/develop/data/json/main_experimental_towns/README.md "README.md")  inside the folder itself.
* [performance_experiments](https://github.com/amehrjou/Pyfectious/tree/develop/data/json/performance_experiments "performance_experiments"): Some experiments to assess the simulator's performance and our basic experiments with the simulator following the recent reviews.
