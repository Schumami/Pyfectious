# Configuration Files

Configuration files in this section correspond to all the experiments we ever designed with Pyfectious. A brief introduction to these setups is as the following.

* **town**: A sample town designed as a single base run for the simulator.
* **test**: Designed test run for faster results with the simulator.
* **town_optimization**: The town we used to optimize quarantine policies.
* **main_experimental_towns**: Most of the results in the paper come from these setups. More details are in the README file inside the folder.
* **performance_optimization**: Some experiments to assess the simulator's performance and our basic experiments with the simulator.
